Half MTTFmin:

## Evaluation and Justification of MTTFmin

To calculate minimum Mean Time Between Failures (MTTF), we used a "brute-force" approach, by playing around with the Failure Intensity Objective (FIO) inputs
on the SRTAT Reliability Demo Chart tool. This method might not have been the best, but due to the vagueness of data provided, and to avoid mis-identifying the data set, we decided to use observations as the guiding force. We evaluted that due to simplistic nature of Reliability Demo Chart, it is easy to get a "glance" of the reliabilty surrounding a system, but it lacks a more quantitative aspect which might help determine exact cause-effects around reliability. 

## Advantages and Disadvantages

An advantage we found when using the SRTAT Reliability Demo Chart Tool was the ease of setting everything up and modelling the data. However, a disadvantage was finding "exact values" or any information which might help us quanitfy the model in real-world terms.
